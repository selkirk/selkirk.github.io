            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)" class="project-link">Logo</a> is a programming language adapted from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)" class="project-link">Lisp</a>. Well-known for its interactions with the <a href="https://youtu.be/g6kmVHfMQvY?t=1m25s" class="project-link">turtle</a> as a way to teach programming in a digestible way, the language is easy to recreate in that its syntax can be represented easily with stacks.

            For a class at Duke, the class was randomly split into team of four to implement a Logo interpreter and overall programming environment. I got really excited for this project once I started, and I ended up implementing most of the parser and environment personally. I took away a lot of lessons about the intricacies of coding and the importance of managing team dynamics from working on this project. Highly recommend looking over this code.
