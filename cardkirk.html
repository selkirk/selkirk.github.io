        <hr />
        <p>
            Cardkirk was a hackathon project for HackDuke 2013 as a prototype for an educational platform for lower-income communities restricted to feature phones (as opposed to smart phones).

        <p>
            I built Cardkirk as a side hackathon project in my spare time at HackDuke while waiting on dependencies from the rest of my team for the main project. What was the main project? It was a contact manager, but the repository and code can no longer be found...

            <strong>Extensions: </strong>An easy extension would be to make this project audio-only, allowing users to study using their Alexas, Cortanas, Siris, and other vocal systems.
